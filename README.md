# Business Site
 
The assignment was to create a business website, practicing the use of JavaScript, HTML DOM, forms and responsive hero images/videos.
 
## The problem
 
I initially didn’t fork and clone the repo, hence why the changes made in this commit are basically the entire contents of the code files, all at once. I should use Git more diligently in the future, as it is good form to do so.
 
For the accordion I chose to use EventListeners instead of onclick due to running into issues with the latter (see this question on Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/c/technigo/questions/2045). I used Maks’s JavaScript EventListener setup, then expanded upon it with (what I think I absorbed from) Van’s lecture; the functionality of only allowing one accordion header open at a time, closing previously opened ones. This was done simply by just adding .remove to the other headers when one was .toggled.
 
I used online images this time for all my images, allowing me to bypass the problem I still haven’t resolved with Netlify and uploaded images.
 
My planning was poor for this project, which I aim to fix for next week. I once again focused on the html and javascript before making the site look more pretty, prioritization which helped me still finish on time.
 
If I had managed my time better, I’d have added an EventListener-powered dropdown for the hamburger icon as well. I’d also have added a footer, and would have cleaned up my structure of the hero image header, as to avoid the awkwardly named section “actual-header”.
